# Hangman

This program incorperates a children's word game. The game is command line based, and incorperates fundamental Python 
to display the graphic (ASCII) picture which shows the progress of the game. 

# GAME INSTRUCTION

The computer has chosen a random word out of a list of english words. You must guess the word letter by letter.
If your guessed letter is in the word, the computer shows you empty lines (= the amount of letters in the word), 
with the correctly guessed letter in the word. You are also provided with a list of letters you have already guessed. 
Remember that some of the letters can be in the word multiple times! 

If your guessed letter is not in the word, then 1 attribute is added to the hangedman. (Order: Head, chest, arm 1, arm 2,
leg 1, leg 2, foot 1, foot 2, hand 1, hand 2). Once the entire man is displayed, you lose. 

Objective: To guess the word letter by letter before displaying the full man. 

# INSTALLATION
